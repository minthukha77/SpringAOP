AOP
Aspect Oriented Programming

concern 

    Service
        auth    => concern
        business logic  => concern
        logging  => concern


    Auth is everywhere in code in entire web applications. Also logging and 
    transaction management.

    This is called cross-cutting concern.

    AOP can solve cross-cutting concern.


AOP Concepts

        1.Aspect => For example=>Auth Aspect, Logging Aspect,Security

        2.Join Point => Run in where contoller,where package,where class?
            For example, all methods in ControllerA, some method in Controller B

        3.Advice => what to do, For eg, "around","before" and "after" contains.

            what means "Around"?

                before  
                    method
                after

            This is called "Around".

        
        4. Pointcut ======> AOP 

            package com.xyz;

            public class Pointcuts {
            
                @Pointcut("execution(public * *(..))")
                public void publicMethod() {}
            
                @Pointcut("within(com.xyz.trading..*)")
                public void inTrading() {}
            
                @Pointcut("publicMethod() && inTrading()")
                public void tradingOperation() {}
            }



        AOP use for security,auth.
        NOT FOR Logger and tracking.



        5.After Throwing =>
            Will do after got Exception

        
        6.After Retruning ==> Will do , after returning from functions,methods.
